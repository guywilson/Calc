# Calc
A command line scientific calculator written in C++. The calculator converts the entered calculation into Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) using the 'Shunting Yard' algorithm before evaluating the result.

Building Calc
-------------
I have provided makefiles for both Windows (compiled using MS Visual Studio C++ 2015 Community Edition and tested on Windows 10) and Unic (compiled using gcc and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit).

Using Calc
----------
The calcuator supports the standard trigometric functions sin(), cos(), tan(), asin(), acos(), atan() and sqrt() and log(). The following operators are supported: +, -, *, / and ^ (power).

The calculator has a self-test mode, just type 'test' once you've entered the calculator in interactive mode.

Enjoy!
